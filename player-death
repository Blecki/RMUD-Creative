Ideas for handling player death

1. The extreme end of the deja vu experience might be exploited here. The PC should not remember dying, or 
   recognize that they did, but upon "waking" in whatever designated area we decide on, the text would 
   point to the PC having just had a hallucanatory experience in the sense of "I did this/I've been here
   before." This could play into the plausible deniabiliy of magic. The PC has been revived through magical
   means, but brushes it off as a fluke of memory. 

2. PC only go unconscious, but do not actually "die." Loss of experience or some equipment would still apply,
   but the tone of the text would be handled to show the player was KO'ed. The PC's return could be handled 
   one of two ways, in this case. The first being that the PC "wakes" where they fell, aggro has been dropped,
   and some sort of protection applied so they player can retreat from the area. The second, which is slightly 
   more involved, but slightly more plausible on the magic-denial side, is that each town has a hospital where
   players wake. After getting KO'ed, their transport to the hospital could be explained as a friendly passerby
   contacting help while the player was uncosncious. 
   
3. PC's all automatically have a device (issued by game world law) that contacts help when the PC's vitals
   fail. Think of the Pipboys in the Fallout series, which could be used to handle other information such as
   stats/scoring, as well as communications. Again, we'd ideally have to have hospitals or clinics in each 
   town so that players have somewhere believable to wake in, but knowing they were KO'ed and revived. This
   idea has a slightly more sci-fi feel, but with the advances in modern smartwatches, I think it holds a lot 
   of value and saves us from having to use magical means of reviving/retreaving players.
